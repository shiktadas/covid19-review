## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### General Background

On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its first report concerning what is now known as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
This infectious disease came to international attention on December 31, 2019 following an announcement by national officials in China about 44 cases of a respiratory track infection of unknown cause.
The first known cases were located in Wuhan City within the Hubei province of China, but the disease spread rapidly beyond Wuhan within China and subsequently around the world.
At the time of the first situation report [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf], 282 confirmed cases had been identified, primarily in China, but also 1-2 exported cases had been identified in several neighboring countries (Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea).
One week later, 4593 confirmed cases had been identified, spanning not only Asia, but also Australia, North America, and Europe [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200128-sitrep-8-ncov-cleared.pdf].
On March 11, 2020, WHO formally classified the situation as a pandemic [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf].
On April 4, 2020, the WHO reported that the global number of confirmed cases had surpassed one million [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200404-sitrep-75-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=99251b2b_4].

COMMENT: Anyone wants to update it to hte latest figure? 

At this time, over 130,000 deaths had been reported due to COVID-19 worldwide (April 15, 2020).

[Note: Maybe add a graph here, update as new reports come out.]
[So this is where manubot is particularly useful. it could pull from a public database / data table.]

In this (systematic?) review, we seek to consolidate information about the virus in the context of related viruses and to synthesize what is known about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and side-effects.
This is a real-time, collaborative effort that welcomes submissions from scientists worldwide.


### About Coronaviruses

#### Classification:

Coronaviruses (CoVs; order *Nidovirales*, family *Coronaviridae*, subfamily *Orthocoronavirinae*) are enveloped viruses with some of the largest viral RNA genomes and helical capsids with the solar corona-like appearance [@isbn:0781760607].
All viruses in the *Nidovirales* order are characterized by: 1) enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genomes with a highly conserved genomic organization; 2) many non-structural genes by ribosomal shifting; 3) several unusual enzymatic activities encoded within the replicase-transcriptase polyprotein; and 4) 3' nested sub-genomic mRNAs [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1].
Coronaviruses are classified into four genera: alpha, beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses.
Among them, alpha and beta coronaviruses infect mammalian species, gamma coronaviruses infect avian species and delta coronaviruses infect both mammalian and avian species [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301].
The viruses were initially subdivided into these genera based on antigenic relationships of the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins but are now divided by phylogenetic clustering.

Most coronaviruses are considered zoonotic viruses with most are introduced to humans via an intermediate host.
A major group of coronaviruses include human coronaviruses (HCoVs) strains associated with multiple respiratory diseases of varying severity, ranging from common cold to severe pneumonia, with severe symptoms mostly observed in immunocompromised individuals [@doi:10.1086/377612].
Approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans is attributable to four out of six previously known human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) that are globally circulating in the human population [@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9;@doi:10.3390/diseases4030026].
In the past two decades, however, highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have been identified, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) although both infections were confined to specific geographic regions [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81;@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9].
The current pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents an acute and rapidly spreading global health crisis with severe or fatal symptoms such as acute respiratory distress, acute lung injury and other pulmonary complications.
The transmission and mortality rate estimations of COVID-19 seems to be varied with country and its age structure.

[this section may be better as a figure panel + legend]
Phylogenetic analysis of a PCR amplicon fragment from five patients along with the total virus genome of 29.8 kilobases indicates that the virus is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the B lineage, also known as sarbecovirus.
The sarbecovirus lineage also includes the human SARS coronavirus [@doi:10/ggjs7j].


#### Virion, morphology, structure:
Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters ranging between 100 to 160nm.
The virion has a lipid envelope with spike (S) glycoproteins on the surface creating a distinctive "crown" shape, for which the family of viruses was named [@isbn:0781760607].


#### Genome structure and replication:
Coronavirus genomes are single-stranded non-segmented positive RNA (ssRNA+) that are 27 to 32kb in length.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome lies in the middle of this range at 29,903 bp in length [@doi:10/ggjr43].
Coronavirus genomes are comprised of a replicase gene that is 2/3 of the genome and the remaining 1/3 that encodes structural proteins including: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.
There are additional accessory genes that are present depending on the strain.
The non-structural polypeptide is translated into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16, except Gammacoronaviruses that do not contain nsp1), which form replication machinery to synthesize viral RNA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25681].

Replication initiates with the binding of the virus to a host cell via the S protein.
The viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the viral genome into the host cytoplasm.
The replicase gene is translated and assembled into the viral replicase complex, which can synthesize dsRNA genome from the genomic ssRNA(+).
The dsRNA genome is then transcribed and replicated to create viral mRNAs and new ssRNA(+) genomes [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1; @url:https://viralzone.expasy.org/30?outline=all_by_species].

#### Transmission
In general, respiratory viruses like coronavirus can have multiple routes of person-to-person transmission including droplet transmission (i.e. inhalation for cough, sneeze), aerosol transmission (i.e. virus suspended in air), and contact transmission (i.e. contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes).
While there does not appear to be experimental evidence to conclude which mode of transmission different coronaviruses use [@doi:10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9], it has been suggested that the coronavirus person-to-person transmission is droplet-based using simulations [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa032867] and trace studies [@doi:10.3390/ijerph15122757]. (PLEASE CHECK THEY ARE NOT PRE-PRINTS AS THEY WONT BE CONSIDERED SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THEN)

### SARS-CoV-2: Origin, Phylogenetics, and Evolution

#### Origin of SARS-CoV-2
The evolutionary origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are not yet fully understood.
Genomic analyses and comparisons to other known coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to have originated from a laboratory -- either purposely engineered and released, or escaped -- and instead evolved naturally in an animal host [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].

Among known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-19 has the closest overall sequence similarity to RaTG13 (~96%) found in a *Rhinolophus affinis* bat [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7], while the receptor binding domain (RBD) is highly similar to that of viruses found in pangolins [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.19.950253].
This suggests that SARS-CoV-19 may have originated in viral reservoirs of similar hosts, however current evidence cannot discriminate an origin of the virus before or after zoonotic transfer to humans [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].

### COVID-19: Mechanisms and Presentation

#### Mechanisms of Coronavirus-driven Disease in Humans

Coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans through the following possible mechanisms...[Summarize relevant mechanisms for cell entry & address evidence for/against ACE2 being important, etc.]

#### Presentation of COVID-19

Retrospective samples of COVID-19 patients described the clinical presentations of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 which included lower respiratory tract infection with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
[@doi:10/ggnxb3] starts from the upper respiratory tract symptoms but targets the cells located in the lower respiratory tract.
The symptoms of infection by SARS-CoV-2 can vary greatly, making it difficult for public health agencies to provide clear recommendations for citizens regarding what symptoms indicate infection and should prompt isolation.
[@doi:10/ggnxb3] found that a higher probability of mortality was associated with older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, as well as high levels of d-dimer.
Mortality might be associated with other biomarkers measured in blood samples including lactate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I, although these analyses may not have been appropriately corrected for multiple testing.
They also found that survivors continued to shed the virus for a median of 20 days and a maximum of at least 37 days. (THIS WILL NEED A REFERENCE) 

### Approaches to Understanding COVID-19

Scientific characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and of the COVID-19 disease it causes is critical to controlling the current pandemic.
Several broad areas of research interact with each other, offering different pieces of information critical to understanding the virus and disease.
A comprehensive understanding of the epidemic must unify basic scientific and medical research with public health and biotechnology.


#### Science & Medicine

Understanding how the virus functions and interacts with the host is foundational to understanding pathogenesis and disease progression and to identifying available and novel approaches to treatment.
Therefore, the fields of virology, immunology, and molecular biology are fundamental to characterizing SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
These topics can be approached using a range of techniques, including characterization of the host response from the cellular to systems level.
Contextualizing SARS-CoV-2 in relation to other viruses that infect humans and other animals can further serve to elucidate the reaction of the human host to viral exposure.
This information, when combined with an understanding of the biology of pharmaceutical and medical interventions, can guide new approaches to treatment.

#### Public Health

One necessary component of determining how to manage the outbreak is to understand epidemiological factors related to the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
These can include characteristics such as when infected individuals are contagious, how the virus is transmitted between individuals, the range of symptoms associated with infection and/or contagiousness in different individuals, and how rapidly the virus propogates between individuals, etc.
The development of diagnostic tools is critical to this goal.
Accurate diagnoses on a large scale is necessary to collect the data needed to develop epidemiological models.
Other areas of public health that address resource availability, inequity, human behavior, and other components that influence people's exposure to pathogens and ability to manage illness will also be critical to mounting a global response to the pandemic.
Currently, this manuscript focuses primarily on contextualizing epidemiological characteristics such as reproduction number and dynamics of transmission that intersect with the fundamental biology of the virus or the development of therapeutic and diagnostic technologies.

#### Biotechnology

##### Diagnostics

Two major concerns within diagnosis include the detection of current infections in individuals with and without symptoms, and the detection of past exposure without an active infection.
In the latter category, identifying whether individuals can develop or have developed sustained immunity is also a major consideration.
The development of high-throughput, affordable methods for detecting active infections and sustained immunity will be critical to understanding and controlling the disease.

- What are approaches that allow us to detect current infection or past exposure for other viruses?
- What is sustained immunity and what are the indicators?

##### Therapeutics

The identification of interventions that can mitigate the effect of the virus on exposed and infected individuals is a significant research priority.
Some possible approaches include the identification of existing pharmaceuticals that reduce the severity of infection, either by reducing the virus' virulence (e.g., antivirals) or managing the most severe symptoms of infection.
Due to the long timeline for the development of novel pharmaceuticals, in most cases, research surrounding possible pharmaceutical interventions focuses on the identification and investigation of existing compounds whose mechanisms may be relevant to COVID-19.
Other foci of current research include the identification of antibodies produced by survivors of COVID-19 and the development of vaccines.
Understanding the mechanisms describing host-virus interactions between humans and SARS-CoV-2 are thus critical to identifying candidate therapeutics.

### Summary
In this review, we seek to consolidate information about efforts to develop strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics as new information is released by the scientific community.
We include information from both traditional peer-reviewed scientific literature and from preprints, which typically have not undergone peer review but have been critically evaluated by the scientists involved in this effort.
The goal of this manuscript is to present preliminary findings within the broader context of COVID-19 research and to identify the broad interpretations of new research, as well as limitations to interpretability.
